# NeuralSpoofer.py  
_An AI-driven RF signal spoofer._  

### What It Does:  
- **Listens to RF signals and generates AI-powered replicas**  
- **Fools devices into accepting fake transmissions as real**  
- **Bypasses rolling codes and secure RF authentication methods**  
- **Can be used to manipulate IoT, security, and drone control systems**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A signal that is trusted does not have to be real."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Train NeuralSpoofer on a captured RF signal:  
   ```bash
   python3 NeuralSpoofer.py --train captured_signal.bin
